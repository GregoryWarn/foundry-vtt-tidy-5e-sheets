## What are Tidy 5e Sheets?

Alternate [D&D 5e](https://github.com/foundryvtt/dnd5e) sheet layouts for [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/), focused on a clean UI, usability, flexibility, and extensibility.

Completely rewritten from the ground up, based on the original [Tidy5e Sheet](https://github.com/sdenec/tidy5e-sheet) module by [sdenec](https://github.com/sdenec) and [4535992](https://github.com/p4535992), and the excellent foundation laid by the 5e system module.

## Installation

We recommend installing this module through Foundry, the Forge Bazaar, or a similar interface for official Foundry packages.


Or, you can still install Tidy manually via the `module.json` URL:

1. Inside the initial Foundry Configuration and Setup screen, open the **Add-on Modules** tab.
2. Press the **Install Module** button.
3. In the **Manifest URL** field, paste in a manifest URL. The "Latest Stable" URL is: 
   `https://github.com/kgar/foundry-vtt-tidy-5e-sheets/releases/latest/download/module.json`
   - See [the foundry package page](<https://foundryvtt.com/packages/tidy5e-sheet/>) for Last Versions for different dnd5e system versions.
4. Press **Install** and wait for installation to complete.
   
### Quick start

1. Enable the module in your game in the **Game Settings** sidebar tab, pressing the **Manage Modules** button and activating **Tidy 5e Sheets**. This activates the module, but you still need to switch sheets to Tidy verions. 
2. Change individual sheets to Tidy using the **three-dot Toggle Controls menu** at the top of each sheet and choosing **Configure sheet.**
3. Globally change all sheets from the **Game Settings** sidebar tab, choosing **Configure Settings**. Here you can change **Core** ‚Üí **Configure Default Sheets**, or **Tidy 5e Sheets** ‚Üí **Set Tidy as Default Sheet**.

## Reporting Issues and Requesting Features

If you are experiencing a bug or have an idea for a new feature, submit a [github issue](https://github.com/kgar/foundry-vtt-tidy-5e-sheets/issues) or begin a discussion in the community discord.

## API-Extensible Sheets

The [Tidy 5e Sheets API](https://kgar.github.io/foundry-vtt-tidy-5e-sheets/) is here to allow for extending the sheets in a variety of supported ways. Because this module uses alternate web technology from the normal Foundry sheets, integrating by API is essential for other modules and for those making world scripts.

#### Need API Functions for Something? Let's Talk

If you need API support for a feature or customization that you have in mind, submit a [github issue](https://github.com/kgar/foundry-vtt-tidy-5e-sheets/issues) or begin a discussion in the community discord.

## Module Compatibility

If a module is not compatible with Tidy 5e Sheets, submit a [github issue](https://github.com/kgar/foundry-vtt-tidy-5e-sheets/issues), and the author will work with other module authors to establish compatibility.


## Tidy 5e Sheets Manifesto

- Tidy 5e Sheets are meant to be nice sheets that make it easy to do D&D in style.
- Tidy 5e Sheets are intended to remain compatible with the current version of the D&D 5e system, including mirroring its Foundry compatibility settings. When there's a system update that has breaking changes, Tidy 5e Sheets will move all current efforts forward to the new D&D 5e version and adjust its minimum system version accordingly.
- This module cannot and should not try to bootstrap all sheet-augmenting modules within its own source code. Modules come and go.
- This module should not become a Kitchen Sink module. Requests that go out of scope cannot be fulfilled.
- This is a community effort. The Maintainer(s) strive to keep an open dialogue with interested users / devs while continuing maintenance and adding features.
