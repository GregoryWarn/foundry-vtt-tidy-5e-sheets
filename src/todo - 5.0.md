## To Fix

- [ ] Convert to App V2
  - [ ] Configure Section
  - [ ] Set Tidy as Default Sheet
  - [ ] Max Prepared Spells Config
  - [ ] Migrations
  - [ ] etc.
- [ ] Convert Character sheet to App V2
- [ ] Convert NPC sheet to App V2
- [ ] Convert Vehicle sheet to App V2
- [ ] Inline the custom Tidy modifications for spellbook preparation; ensure modules can still add spells / sections and have Tidy perform a post-operation to backfill spell section keys / Tidy props.
- (hightouch) the radio buttons on Foundry 13 are wonky / see container sort longpress menu

## App V1 to upgrade to V2

Assign Spells to Classes
Configure Section
Set Tidy as Default Sheet
Etc.

Possibly convert the actor sheets to app V2 since any base-class-dependent functionality will be broken anyway
