## To Do

- [ ] Item changes are not reflecting on the character sheet when changed from the item sheet. Change an item name and see it not update
  - The actor sheet does rerender, but the item table row does not update.
  - [ ] Fix: All `#each` loops that reference Foundry classes must reference a POJO wrapper instead. Suggested approach: derived collection that stitches in any additional data like itemContext or unidentified name, to bypass the need for `@const` content.
    - [x] Spellbook Grid
    - [x] Spellbook List
    - [ ] Actor Effects Tab
    - [ ] Inventory Grid
    - [ ] Inventory List
    - [ ] Favorite Activities List
    - [ ] Favorite Facilities List
    - [ ] Favorite Features List
    - [ ] Favorite Spells List
    - [ ] Character Effects tab
    - [ ] Character Features tab
    - [ ] Container Contents sections
    - [ ] Encounter Member List
    - [ ] Group Member List
    - [ ] Item Active Effects Tab
    - [ ] maybe: ItemAdvancementTab
    - [ ] maybe: ItemSpeciesDescriptionTab
    - [ ] NPC Abilities Tab
    - [ ] Cargo List
    - [ ] PassengerOrCrewList
    - [ ] VehicleAttributesTab
    - [ ] ContainerContentsSections
    - [ ] AttunementSummaryTooltip
    - [ ] GroupLanguageTooltip
    - [ ] GroupSkillTooltip
    - [ ] OccupantSummaryTooltip
- [ ] Info Cards are not reactive to their target items or actors
  - This does not rerender when the item/actor changes. This can be remedied by subscribing self to their list of apps to update on change.
  - Rendering alone will not help. Triggering a render doesn't update the card. The card data has to be refreshed somehow.
  - Try a coarse reactivity provider whose data is set on each render, and sign up the card to refresh when any of its related entities are updated.
- [ ] Attached info cards in popout force some width onto the popout window. Any idea how to get around that? Maybe some trick with parent container width perhaps?
- [ ] Container Panel ctx menu seems to be getting confused when clicking Edit.

 
## Stretch, or defer to post V7.3.0

- [ ] Overhaul: Item Filter Service is a mess. Is there a way to consolidate all functionality to the ItemFilterService so that it can serve up reactive filters all the way through?
- [ ] Optimize: Section Config prep / setup
  - Section config is a little cumbersome to deal with right now. It is requiring a `sections` param on the utility toolbar command params and a duplicate set of section data for container.
  - Can we isolate the actual section preparation, indpependent of the item preparation for those sections? Can that be shared?
  - Can the section config application somehow do the isolated section ordering / showing / hiding / etc. by itself?
- [ ] Refactor: `Tabs` wants a sheet prop so it can check if a tab navigation is allowed and to trigger some tab selection events when permitted. Now that context sans stores has been upended in Svelte 5, consider instead sending exactly what `Tabs` needs for its specific use case as context from the sheet, directly, in the form of a callback or function binding.
- [ ] Fix: Use the broken identify toggle for containers to vet error handling and getting latest from the source data. Or, if it's not feasible, just catch and handle error.

## Testing To Dos

- [x] Smoke test every sheet
- [x] Test Checkboxes and other inputs that formerly had a `draftValue` and see if they now just work as expected
  - [x] Select : needs it
  - [x] Checkbox : no need
  - [x] ContentEditableFormField : needed it
  - [x] NumberInput : no need
  - [x] TextInput : no need
- [x] Especially test Select elements with empty options, null options, and with default blank string options
- [x] Especially test item cards
- [x] Action filter override control (had some odd run/derived behavior)
- [x] SpellbookList component, controls (had some elaborate run/derived behavior)
- [x] Test Sheet Editor V2 fairly closely
- [x] Test: Floating card with PopOut! : it forces the popout window to accommodate the card width ðŸ˜¬
- [x] Test: Detached card with PopOut! : it always thinks we're too far right and favors left
- [x] Test: Detached card reactivity with changes : it doesn't react

## Notes and Examples

### Dealing with Sheet getData Context Reactivity

Switching from a store to a state rune with the `context` property on the sheet classes has almost completely broken reactivity. This is because the context itself has to be provided via a getter or some other closure. With that mind, _there is no other choice than to introduce an extra property in the prop path throughout the sheets code surface area._ Add to this Svelte 5 does not provide reactivity for classes, only POJOs (see https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/10560#issuecomment-2057092046). If I am keeping with the current context property scheme, then I need to wrap the entire context in the aforementioned `External` class:

```ts
export class External<T> {
  #data;
  #version = $state(0);

  constructor(data: T) {
    this.#data = data;
  }
  get data() {
    this.#version;
    return this.#data;
  }
  set data(_data) {
    this.#version++;
    this.#data = _data;
  }
  invalidate() {
    this.#version++;
  }
}
```

Then, all references to `context.something` must reference as `context.data.something`. This will ensure that all fields are reactive again.

**Update**: We can achieve this in terser fashion and still remain svelte-idiomatic:

```ts
function getCharacterSheetContext() {
  return getContext<{ data: CharacterSheetContext }>('context').data;
}

// In the component:
let context = $derived(getCharacterSheetContext());
```

### How to handle custom events, Clickoutside event handler example

https://svelte.dev/playground/8031c800d7e34fd692dd18174b514e4e?version=5.3.0

```svelte
<script>
	function clickOutside(element, callbackFunction) {
		function onClick(event) {
			if (!element.contains(event.target)) {
				callbackFunction();
			}
		}

		document.body.addEventListener('click', onClick);

		return {
			update(newCallbackFunction) {
				callbackFunction = newCallbackFunction;
			},
			destroy() {
				document.body.removeEventListener('click', onClick);
			}
		}
	}
	let showModal = false;
</script>

{#if showModal}
	<div class="modal"
			 use:clickOutside={() => {
		     console.log('clicked outside');
		     showModal = false;
		   }}>
		Some Modal
	</div>
{:else}
	<button on:click={(event) => {
		showModal = true;
		event.stopPropagation();
	}}>Open Modal</button>
{/if}

<style>
	.modal {
		padding: 16px;
		border: 1px solid black;
	}
</style>
```

### async work in `$effect()` runes

### Event Handler types in Svelte 5

Svelte 5 has convenience types for event handler functions!

- `MouseEventHandler<HTMLElement>`
- `FocusEventHandler<HTMLElement>`
- etc.

### Accordion Item error

```
AccordionItem.svelte:33 [svelte] state_proxy_equality_mismatchReactive `$state(...)` proxies and the values they proxy have different identities. Because of this, comparisons with `===` will produce unexpected results
```

### Floating Card Notes

- ~~Trial 1:~~

If floating, simply reposition the card on mousemove within sheet element, whether visible or not.

- [x] Trial 2: ðŸ”¥

When showing, turn on an effect which triggers tracking and positioning the card, directly correlated with the shown element.

Debrief:

- [x] Trial 3:

Cry.

## Reactivity Troubleshooting for Item Table Rows

ðŸš· Things that aren't reacting to change:
- Item Name
- Qty
- Item Summary

âœ… Things that are reacting:
- Equip/Unequip
- Attune
- Item Weight
- Activity add/delete/rename
- Item add/delete

THOERY: After some extensive testing, the ActorInventoryTab call to `$derived(SheetSections.configureInventory(...))` is where reactivity stops. This call does the following:
- Sort keyed sections
- Sort items in section
- Determine section visibility

This was meant to allow for deferred execution and therefore deferred computation, so when a user didn't use a tab, this calculation was not done. For whatever reason, this call is causing svelte to be unable to detect changes, even when this function is passed in to a `CoarseReactivityProvider`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `@const` is reactive; it's not the problem

UPDATED THEORY: I removed the custom section config from the equation and tried again. Latest results:

**Without custom section config:**

Reactive:
- In Inventory Tab
- In Inventory List, outside of Item Table body
- In Inventory List, inside of Item Table body, outside of loop

Not Reactive:
- In Inventory List, **inside of Item Table body loop**
- In Inventory List, **inside of Item Table body loop** item table row
- In Inventory List, outside of Item Table body, **inside an each loop**

I added it back and retested. ***Same results as without. So the custom section content is not the culprit.***

So, it seems that reactivity breaks when we start the each loop on the section. It doesn't matter what component it's in. The each loop is not refreshing.

Next thing to try: *wrap the Item reference with a `value` getter*

**EUREKA**: Looping over a wrapper with a value getter solves the problem. Deep class reactivity *would be fucking nice, Svelte*, but since that is not an option, any each loop needs to loop over POJOs. Does it specifically need a getter? **Nope, you can just use a wrapped object, no getter required.**




### Reactivity Scratch

```
const sword = fromUuidSync('Actor.jyVFPunMzXbhlAUe.Item.fnBoDKvOSltAIe7l');
const newName = sword.name.endsWith('1') ? sword.name.substring(0, sword.name.length - 1) : sword.name + '1';
fromUuidSync('Actor.jyVFPunMzXbhlAUe.Item.fnBoDKvOSltAIe7l').update({ name: newName});
```

    - [x] prepare necessary scaffolding for T Inspect
    - [x] ~~allow hover on card to keep the card shown, as long as there's still a component to view~~ / not worth it. Press T to Inspect
  - [x] Plant all activity attributes for actors, containers, items
- [x] Fixit: Hide card on drag
- [x] Fixit: choppy floating card;
  - Idea for fixing it: simply have the card follow the mouse while on the sheet âœ…
    - This can simply be an effect on the component, related to the floating setting.
- [x] T Inspect!
  - [x] Implement Detached Card component
  - [x] Figure out how to get a title on there for the affected entity; this may just be a requirement when setting up Card State
  - [x] Header Height should always be card title height (sort of... it should be the height of one line of the header.)
  - [x] The stock header should be absolutely positioned with transparent background, with close button
  - [x] Should be able to minimize and see the item card title~~/color~~; getting the color is too damned complicated. Forget it.
  - [x] When opening the card, set its width/height to the prescribed card dimensions, accounting for root font size adjustments from Foundry
  - [x] The card content should span the entirety of the application surface area
  - [x] Ensure the show/hide/transition/transform styles do not apply to the popped out / inspected card; they should only apply to the attached card; ==attached== should perhaps be a class on the attached card
  - [x] Should "inspected" instead be "detached"? Yes.
- [x] Item Card Refinement: Shift from mouseover to mouseleave with hiding cards. This is going to be tricky. Make sure it works in a variety of scenarios. One idea: when showing the card for an event target, then wire the mouseleave on that target to ensure show turns off when that target is left.
- [x] Fixit: Accordion Item error
- [x] Fix: Item Identified / Equipped toggles are not processing switch change events properly
- It's the underlying Tidy Switch
- [x] Fix inventory grid styles

- [x] Fix: Item sheets are not showing selected tabs
- [x] Fix: Theme Settings, lots and lots of warnings
- [x] Fix: Make Coloris' theme mode match Tidy's
- [x] Replace stores with runes
- [x] Convert sheet subscriptions to sheet effects and test sheet effects
- [x] Resolve runtime errors related to section/item deferred prep.
- [x] Convert all sheet contexts to `External<T>` (renamed to `CoarseReactivityProvider`)
- [x] Update all sheet context functions to return `result.data` instead of `result`
- [x] Update all callers of context functions to use `$derived(contextFn())`
- [x] Review auxiliary applications to determine their need for coarse reactivity. As a general rule, it's just the ones with live reactivity.
