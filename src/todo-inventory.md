## Inventory To Do

Refactor:

- [x] Switch from hideUnder to priority show/hide scheme
- [x] Have each use of a column provide a priority
- [x] Propagate to Containers as well
- [X] Test inventory and container contents
- [x] Rename ContainerContentsSections to ItemLists
- [x] Parameterize row actions
- [x] Solve Problem: Column Visibility algorithm has no awareness of action column width, so it minimize visibility of the item name without hiding columns
  - [x] Pull row actions back into TidySectionBase
  - [x] Add an actions column at highest priority and set its width to the calculated width in pixels instead of rems
  - [x] Increase the column props to include the TidyBaseSection from whence this column comes
- [x] Supply Table Row Actions to inline and standlone container contents
- [ ] Ensure all empty inventory sections are shown.
- [ ] Add an Add Button to all sections. Have it open the item creation dialog with the item type pre-selected, if dealing with a default section.
- [ ] Change attune button to Display-Only and put to the right of the item name button as an indicator
- [ ] Implement action bar
  - [ ] While there, implement generic width / priority observer feature that can control pinned filter visibility generically
  - [ ] Propagate this to the container action bar
- [ ] Implement container panel
- [ ] Propagate Table Row Actions to Activities tables
- [ ] Propagate Table Row Actions to Effects tables
- [ ] Propagate Data-Driven Columns to Activities tables
- [ ] Propagate Data-Driven Columns to Effects tables
- [ ] `ItemColumnRuntime.determineHiddenColumns` - use this to pre-calculate column widths and to return a column scheme type that excludes width functions.
- [ ] Expand column width calculations to include support for other measurements like REMs. Calculate the root rem on Foundry ready `parseFloat(getComputedStyle(document.body).fontSize)` and anytime settings change.
  - Bonus: promote the UI Scale watcher and its hook to a centralized location where Tidy pulls its core setting info as a reactive store.
- [ ] Evolve ItemLists further
  - ðŸ’¡ It is still for Items only, which should keep things simple with itemContext usage.
  - Move columns to TidySectionBase and include in prep
  - Extract the Tidy Table rendering components for churning out columns from column specs. This functionality will be reused for Effects and Activity tables.
- [ ] Review and task further

## Questions

- How does UI Scale actually factor into the styles of things? Is it independent of Font Size, or does it scale everything, including font size?

## Write-up about rem column / row action widths

Right now, I'm doing column widths and row action widths as pixels, because I need to be able to do width calculations.
After a little tinkering, I see I can do rems instead, which I greatly prefer. You can tell me otherwise.

The way I would do REMs: 
I have a cache of the Foundry UI settings of interest - UI Scale, Font Size,
On Foundry Ready event, and whenever settings are changed, I refresh my cached settings,
When doing column widths, I can include the measurement as a string prop to the side of my width number prop--I'll support px and rem. Some/most users may prefer px when doing their custom columns in the future.,
When calculating column hiding, I'll convert rem widths to pixels for precision measuring,

This will allow for us to support font-size and UI scaling options. I'll also feel much better about hardcoded widths if we're using rems.

## Formula Column notes

```hbs
<div class="item-detail item-formula {{#unless entry.labels.damages.length}}empty{{/unless}}" data-column-id="formula">
    {{#each entry.labels.damages}}
    <div class="row">
        <span class="formula">{{ formula }}</span>
        {{#with (lookup @root.labels.damageAndHealing damageType)}}
        <span data-tooltip aria-label="{{ label }}">
            <dnd5e-icon src="{{ icon }}"></dnd5e-icon>
        </span>
        {{/with}}
    </div>
    {{/each}}
</div>
```
