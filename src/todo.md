## To Do

- [ ] IMPORTANT: All Foundry documents being passed to svelte components are no longer consistently reactive. Spell images work, for example, but Inventory images do not. Rather than try to fight this, use the surefire fix.
- [ ] Fix: Copying an advancement from item to another when it's Tidy to Tidy doesn't seem to work. Determine what the defaults are doing and try to do likewise.
  - Solution: wrap in a pojo. Bare minimum: `{ value: item }`
- [ ] Character Sheet 
  - [x] Start dev in Foundry V12
  - [x] Establish components for the tabs
  - [x] Set up Quadrone runtime content, including the default tabs
  - [ ] Set up new tab selection for quadrone sheets
  - [ ] Implement tabs
    - [ ] Actions
    - [ ] Attributes
    - [ ] Inventory
    - [ ] Features
    - [ ] Spellbook
    - [ ] Effects
    - [ ] Background
    - [ ] Journal
  - [ ] Implement Expandable/collapsible sidebar
  - [ ] Implement Pins
  - [ ] Implement Favorites
  - [ ] Implement Responsive Tab Strip
  - [ ] Implement Theme Settings
    - [ ] Client Default
    - [ ] Actor Sheet Override
    - [ ] Item Sheet Override
  - [ ] Implement Limited View, which branches just within the top-level sheet component.
- [ ] Scaffold the NPC Sheet in Foundry V12
- [ ] Scaffold the Group Sheet in Foundry V12
- [ ] Scaffold the Vehicle Sheet in Foundry V12
- [ ] add a class to section headers when there are no search results `.search-no-results`
- [ ] All section configs: pass in callback for preparing sections to view, so that we're not processing this during non-option-sheet renders. It should only render on option sheet prerender.
- [ ] Configure {TabId}: include a hook that allows people to pass in their own settings.
- [ ] SortingListbox - add touch support for drag and drop, if possible; and if it works out, remove the arrow buttons.
- [ ] Resolve TODO -  // TODO: Make this a callback to send through to the component for preparing sections properly
- [ ] Item cards
  - [ ] Implement a shared portal for item cards. All attached item cards will use the one portal anchor. This is so the card can live outside the sheet's overflow hiding window content, so we don't have to worry about compromising design.
  - [ ] Have item cards be targeted via `.tidy5e-sheet.classic....` etc.
  - [ ] Test spell info on item summary and cards
  - [x] ~~For fun, test with PopOut!~~
- [ ] Effect Summary eagerly refreshes. Add suppression to HTML enrichment to only when the effect summary is shown.
- [ ] Additional Document header option: Context Menu Options (literally show the context menu options)
- [ ] Ensure all item sheets enforce this Unidentified UI feature:
    - [ ] (Non-container sheets only) Sidebar sections all hidden except Sections section and pill switches
- [ ] Context Menu items rework
- [ ] Fix weird minimize/maximize header text behavior. reference: https://discord.com/channels/@me/1243307347682529423/1357922036454002890
- [ ] Add background circle hover style to section row buttons
- [ ] Always track and ensure that `currentTabId` is correct on the sheet. Use a getter/setter, and under the hood, use a stateful object. Make "change tab" function available and have it trigger rerenders.


### Scratch - Finding the effective theme for a sheet

```js
// Get document sheet config theme
const theme = foundry.applications.apps.DocumentSheetConfig.getSheetThemeForDocument(options.document);
theme // 'light' | 'dark' | '' | ???

// Getting top-level application default theme
const { colorScheme } = game.settings.get("core", "uiConfig");
colorScheme.applications // 'light' | 'dark' | '' | ????

// Getting browser default
    let browserDefault;
    if ( matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches ) browserDefault = "theme-dark";
    else if ( matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: light)").matches ) browserDefault = "theme-light";
```


### Bonus

- [ ] Activity card / summary: Activities can be summarized via activity.activationLabels
  - all: activation, duration, range, reach, target
  - item is weapon with no overrides: attack: range, reach

### Electron Client Issues

- [ ] The button panel menu is appearing behind tables in the Container Sheet.

### Context Menu items rework

https://discord.com/channels/@me/1243307347682529423/1353196795378929754

Here's my recommendation for action order following menu order best practices:
- Most commonly used on the top
- Destructive actions sunk to the bottom
- Related content grouped

```
Edit
Equip
Add favorite

### To Include on Actor Phase

- [ ] Effects tab
  - [ ] Info / Suppression UI https://discord.com/channels/@me/1243307347682529423/1351751313515479131
  - Repro: Put on a ring of protection but don't equip/attune to it.

### Stretch

- [ ] ButtonWithOptionsPanel - can the menu be outside the hidden window content and still anchor to the position of the menu? Very possible with a Portal. See https://svelte.dev/playground/8364bc976f0c4ff9b83adf6e7a3c19fd?version=5.22.5#H4sIAAAAAAAACp1V34-jNhD-V7zu6gJSBOqu1AcCOV3vpS-V-l6qrgNDcOPYlj1kN0L875VtCOQ2e7vaFwQzH9_8numpZEegGf1LGWSCrmnDBVia_d1TPGuncQK6nnDftE7sCQQ62Y5ZuCWvlESQaGlGc1sZrnFbyhL5USuDpCeVAYYQTJKBNEYdSUmTlFXIlbQl3Szg39VRKwkSZ9xFNJocfxCA5Kg6iVCTgjRMWNiUMk9nF2Ru8SzAe5MwrUnv3krcseqwN6qTdUYsAoid6GATdJrVNZf7jPz6m37xssE92ofp5yMzey5_1Cc6hDeCKiWUychzy_Ft4mtHdGe0gJlx1yEq-TOreXoJT-Y1P5FKMGuLkjKtS-qjztuH7Tet87R9CN8O1lnIljUp-lWj1Gq4_B9iGSkcyeM2IPO0fQw8ac1P3vDbnDtmPseJ_S-8mUo7jPi5L9KASXnjdfmYKCWzSvDqUPRRTIotiebeuBtf42FL-kn8law66T9WJCMr_zZ332ogeRqYty7TwTW6pggvSDM0HQzrN4Zm7OvkP3s9NFfyxdBcBgV5dZgHZNnsslLSIglJ_PfINCmIhGfyJ9NRvCklvHiKppPextXIRVLVsCbcZaKkNTSsE1jSOLRWID7AmRTk6f4-WEjue14PT2EuGxLNdpOW2egA5zgm2Br1TJ7qTgteMYTRO89VUs9Q0sABwsLC-cQCOpI1ca7FHmIAOyNJT2qwaNQ5W-JrEICQ7LisF76snamYDJtSDqW8xO4rOQbtAf0Uxt3P4ujkQapnOUVx3x_gPKYg5KhVFkmxdGsfwggBOHXCpQWDv0OjDIwuyE6IqxCjuNh6sGsBxqX1wJh8-eJNJAaO6gTfWy7qaMrP8LrE-gPFdStyzOfmw8W-maUwha5BozjBFmQUpmxcTyWOZkjxKv_jrhviuRXeAb_uhWBs_PyaRJeqf2wif7wg13N5Q_veSdPvHDOX-BMTHfiy_AFCqAC92Lr71BVzq7b_2D0RfN9ipQwTb92L8UI8bi9Ozbt4Ut9cxoudr68uyLb3QQ_zKl8s6hJzLnWHxI1xFrKTTufg80s8jIvf4cGZ1bDY3PNZub3D_xn-BxsHJbcUCQAA or obsidian dev vault
- [ ] hightouch: If it's super simple (and only if it's super simple) it could be nice to hard link some of the currency/weight/item type directly to the fields (e.g. click it, opens the tab, focuses the input). But if it's not out-of-the-box it's not worth it. Just wasn't sure if it was actually possible

### Observer and Limited permissions for container sheets

Observer:
- Cannot
  - Change item quantities
  - Use item
  - Add item / see add button at all
  - edit currencies
  - edit anything in details
  - see or toggle mode; stays in Play Mode
  - Change sheet type
  - Identify
  - Equip
- Context menu
  - View Item
  - Display in Chat
- Can only see main description

Limited:
- Identical to Observer

### To Do Graveyard

- [x] (hightouch) Style Effects tab header buttons
- [x] (hightouch) Rarity colors review
- [x] (hightouch) Review Effects tab and apply any polish
- [x] Get Tidy tables working properly and looking nice with the latest styles
  - [x] New quantity control is wider than its 80px parent
  - [x] The table styles do not account for varying column widths and do not constrain child contents
  - [x] Item Name should truncate when too small
  - [x] Section header name should truncate when too small
  - [x] Tighten up actions column scaling for icons
  - [x] Add breakpoints for showing/hiding content, and add columns
    - [x] Charges : order to hide - 4
    - [x] Price : order to hide - 1
    ~~- [ ] Time : order to hide - 2~~
    - [x] Quantity : order to hide - 5
    - [x] Weight : order to hide - 3
  - [x] Finish creating quadrone-specific table components so that inline activities and item (document) summary can be owned by quadrone and classed accordingly.
- [x] Iterate on container tables
  - [x] Container expander to left, always visible. Item Desc / Activity expander on right, hidden until hovered, merely a visual indicator and not a separate clickable area, but always visible when expanded.
    - [x] Inline container contents
    - [x] Item Desc / Activities
  - [x] Add rarity colors to images
- [x] Add user preference sheet width memoization
~~- [ ] Expand/collapse All Sections is not working; fix it so container toggles work with it~~
- [x] Bug: On drop to container sheet, new item is counted but cannot appear until full refresh. Fix: Svelte update.
- [x] Implement filter menu / active button support
- [x] Implement sort button functionality and menu
  - [x] component
  - [x] context data for container
  - [x] sort logic for inventory items
  - [x] consolidate: put all sort-related content in a centralized location for sorting, similar to item filters (the runtime, the default filters, etc.)
  - [x] priority subtitle (include on model as `subtitle` and generically include, instead of using special treatment)
- [x] Implement section config / https://www.figma.com/design/seCsgsf8Uh82uxfPXIwFAg/Tidy5e-Sheet-Refresh?node-id=2182-75324&m=dev
  - [x] Migrate universal quadrone styles from items.scss to apps.scss so that items and options dialogs just work, given the right classes.
  - [x] Code up the section selection form and provide a means for passing in custom options.Depeneding on complexity of available options, consider making it data-driven.
    - [x] Display Options: Show container row (or equivalent preexisting loc key)
  - [x] Apply styles
  - [x] Clean up styles and organize
    - [x] Isolate listbox to its own component
    - [x] Make the options dialog styles specific to tab configuration with a TODO to share styles with other dialogs

- [x] Fix: Weightless container (Bag of Devouring) shows undefined in the Holds text
- [x] Sorting: Resolve todo - // TODO: This needs to be part of the sort group model, relating sort methods to specific groups.
- [x] (hightouch) Complete dark mode for the container
- [x] Implement three dots onclick for container contents item rows
- [x] Inventory: Container inline capacity UI
  - Capacity column
  - For custom sections, let the columns be what they are, but let the container still do its same thing
  - [x] It's time to roll out per-section column specification
    - [x] Draft the proof of concept with Container Contents.
    - [x] Decide: Column spec in runtime, or in context prep? 
      - Leaning toward runtime, with the columns being pulled for use in the component where they are needed, to defer their processing to when their tab is pulled in. Propagating the columns through context is burdensome and far too distributed. Consolidating to a runtime file also makes it easier to manage settings, API callers, import/export, etc.
    - [x] ~~Explore: Can we toggle between Container columns and non-container columns, using a `condition` callback?~~ Using an override system with a fallback to the default column setup. API / World / Client / Sheet-flag settings will progressively override this.
  - [x] Properly pull column specs for each section in container contents
  - [x] Separate capacity bar and values into their own columns, favoring showing the bar when in small view.
    - [x] Both columns have no header content.
  - [x] Polish and finish capacity bar
- [x] Container: Image click behaviors
  - [x] Locked - Show preview
  - [x] Unlocked - File Picker

  - Of note: the container is re-rendering. It's probably the item summary itself.
- [x] Effect description changes are not reactive on the target item container
- [x] Determine how unidentified should work
  - [x] Item row
    - [x] (kgar says: "we should match system behavior for this one: the button is enabled and usable on the default sheets") Use button greyed out, cannot be used
    - [x] Item row text italicized, light grey, no background color
    - [x] Item row image greyscale, opacity 75%
    - [x] Item description uses unidentified description only
    - [x] Charges hidden (emdash)
    - [x] Price hidden (emdash)
  - [x] All sheets

- [x] (hightouch) Quadronify src\applications\section-selector\SectionSelector.svelte?
- [x] Section Selector - swap in the Search component, if possible.
- [x] Localize Container sheet name
- [x] Update section selector to adopt its parent sheet's theme. Solution: make it a DocumentSheet. (Solved: only works for Quadrone sheets, though.)
- [x] Activity Edit ctx menu doesn't work from Classic or Q item sheet :/ | the context menu is unable to find the appropriate list item in order to run its handler.
- [x] Implement Activities tab
- [x] Implement Effects tab
- [x] Finish implementing container contents tab
- [x] Spell TODOs
  - [x] Pact magic upcast in header subtitle after; e.g., "3rd Level (Cast at 4th), Evocation"

    - enabled: fa-toggle-large-on
    - disabled: fa-toggle-on
- [x] `align-content` doesn't work with some machines. Replace with basic flex styles where able.
  - It was the damned Electron client. This problem may resolve itself in Foundry 13, but it has implications for dnd5e 3.3.1 port.

- [x] (hightouch) Review / refine Advancement table styles. Need handling for tags, enrichers, etc.
- [x] (hightouch) Editor / longform style requests
  - [x] in our editor styles, can we do something more with the blockquote element? For example, check how the default sheets do blockquotes: italicize, with a left gray border (2-4px, or so), to make it really stand out as a quote.
  - [x] A user requested we don't use a gap in our `<hr>` elements in the Editor / rendered styles. https://discord.com/channels/1167985253072257115/1170003836556017755/1357755740391215357
- [x] Not sure how feasible it would be but I'm noticing when we open a sheet that Tab still swaps between tokens on the canvas. Is it possible to steal tab focus when a sheet opens and give it to the first open tab? Then you could hit Tab to switch between sheet tabs on open https://discord.com/channels/@me/1243307347682529423/1355184980623491172
