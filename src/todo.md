- [x] Update inputs to ensure that a lockedValue can be fed into each type, so that we can show the system value on disabled and the source value on not disabled ‚ô•
- [x] Ensure all standard form fields are locked on sheet lock
- [x] <!-- TODO: Figure this out; where is the system vs. source value? -->

- [x] Item Descriptions for enchanted items are multiplying the enchanted text. Stahp
- [x] Add currency and weight to relevant item sheets in the header area
