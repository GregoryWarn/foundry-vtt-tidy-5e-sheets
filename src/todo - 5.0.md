## To Fix

- World Settings / User Settings buttons are wonky in App V2; height issues, flex issues
- World Settings Custom Sections Add button doesn't re-sync the UI
- (hightouch) the radio buttons on Foundry 13 are wonky / see container sort longpress menu
- ... am I using `submitOnClose` wrong? The default sheets use it, and it appears in a different part of the DEFAULT_SETTINGS object

## App V1 to upgrade to V2

Tab Selection
Assign Spells to Classes
Configure Section
Set Tidy as Default Sheet
Etc.

Possibly convert the actor sheets to app V2 since any base-class-dependent functionality will be broken anyway
