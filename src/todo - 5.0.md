## To Fix

- [ ] Convert to App V2
  - [ ] MigrationSelectionApplication
- [ ] Convert Character sheet to App V2
- [ ] Convert NPC sheet to App V2
- [ ] Convert Vehicle sheet to App V2
- [ ] Apply `id` to default options for singleton application windows (the settings applications; app v2 inheritors)
- [ ] Remove Tidy theme selection dropdown
- [ ] Inline the custom Tidy modifications for spellbook preparation; ensure modules can still add spells / sections and have Tidy perform a post-operation to backfill spell section keys / Tidy props.
- (hightouch) the radio buttons on Foundry 13 are wonky / see container sort longpress menu
