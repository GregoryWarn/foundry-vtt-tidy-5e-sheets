### Tabs

By default, the new character sheet ships with nine tabs‚ÄîSheet, Character, Inventory, Spellbook, Features, Effects, Biography, Bastion, and Journal.

Sometimes referred to as the "Action" tab, the Sheet tab automatically pulls together all of your items, spells, and features which have some form of action economy available.

Throughout the sheet, the Bookmark represents whether an item is included in the Sheet tab. Some items are included automatically, but if you would prefer to exclude those, you can toggle the bookmark.

### Custom Sections

### Homebrew: Banked Inspiration

Do you want to give your players more inspiration? Tidy 5e Sheets includes Homebrew configuration. There, you can activate "Banked Inspiration."

<img width="802" height="696" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a88379d-8ac9-4610-8f24-3bd0cda1cc49" />

### Inline Containers

### Theme Customization

Customize the look and feel of your sheets, including sheet header background, colors, and other aspects with Tidy Theme Settings. Themes can be set at the world level as a default for all sheets, and then at the sheet level itself. Child sheets like items will inherit the theme of their parent actor sheet automatically.
