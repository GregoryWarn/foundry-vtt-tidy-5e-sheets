## To Do

### Bootstrapping all item sheets

- [ ] Get Tidy tables working properly and looking nice with the latest styles
  - [ ] New quantity control is wider than its 80px parent
  - [ ] The table styles do not account for varying column widths and do not constrain child contents
  - [ ] Finish creating quadrone-specific table components so that inline activities and item (document) summary can be owned by quadrone and classed accordingly.
- [ ] Replace rote individual span styles with util styles where able
- [ ] Implement sheet header contents

- [ ] Ensure Activities and Effects tabs include item counters in the title
  - [ ] This will need context-dependent tab titles, if they don't already exist

- [ ] Add context-dependent Tab visible / enabled predicate option to Tidy tabs, so that concealed content can entirely hide a tab, if needed
- [ ] Handle unidentified feature set
  - [ ] Portrait becomes washed over
  - [ ] Non-description tabs become disabled (preferably, hide them?)
- [ ] Wire up item-sheet-specific user sheet preferences for width and height. Look for other opportunities, also, like container toolbar.

### Stretch

- [ ] Hightouch: If it's super simple (and only if it's super simple) it could be nice to hard link some of the currency/weight/item type directly to the fields (e.g. click it, opens the tab, focuses the input). But if it's not out-of-the-box it's not worth it. Just wasn't sure if it was actually possible
